# Unit tests to the policy manager

## Unity

The framework used to execute the unit tests is **Unity**. Download Unity in the same folder as you have the neat project.

You can download Unity here:  https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/Unity


## Quick start

To **build** the unit tests to the policy manager:

```
$ cd neat/policy_manager/unit_tests
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```

The unit tests can now be **executed** with

```
$ ./test_pm
```
