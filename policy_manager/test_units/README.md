# Test units to the policy manager

## Unity Framework

The framework used to execute the unit tests is **Unity**. In order to execute the unit tests, download Unity in the same folder as you have the neat project.

You can download Unity here:  https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download


## Quick start

To **build** the unit tests to the policy manager:

```
$ cd neat/policy_manager/test_units
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```

The unit tests can now be **executed** with

```
$ ./test_pm
```
